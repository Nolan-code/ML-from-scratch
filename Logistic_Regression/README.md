#  Logistic Regression - Type of tumor Prediction

## Project Description
First implementation of logistic regression from scratch to predict the type of a tumor based on physical aspects features. This project includes feature selection, model training, and comprehensive visualization. The model is first implemented using libraries and then manually from scratch. The goal of the manual implementation is to deepen my understanding of linear regression.

## Key Features
- Feature Selection: from multiple environmental factors
- Linear Regression: implementation with sklearn library and manual implementation
- Performance Comparison between different feature sets
- Data Visualization with matplotlib and pandas
