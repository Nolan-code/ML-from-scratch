#  K_means classification - wine quality Prediction

## Project Description
First implementation of K-means classificaion algorythm from scratch to predict wine quality based on features such as pH, acidity and others. This project includes feature selection, model training, and comprehensive visualization. The model is first 
implemented manually from scratch and then using libraries. The goal of the manual implementation is to deepen my understanding of k-means classification method.

## Key Features
- Feature Selection: from multiple chemical factors of the wine
- K-means classification: implementation with sklearn library and manual implementation
- Data Visualization with matplotlib and pandas

## Selected Features
- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acidity
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfure dioxyde
- total sulfure dioxyde
- density
- pH
- sulfate
- alcohol

## Results Summary with sklearn library
- silhouette score of 0.19
- The model isn't really good but still acceptable

## Results Summary with manual implementation
- silhouette score of 0.18
- Same conclusion
