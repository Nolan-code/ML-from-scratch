#  GDA Model - Type of tumor Prediction

## Project Description
First implementation of GDA model from scratch to predict the type of a tumor based on physical aspects features. This project includes model training and comprehensive visualization(the dataset is the same as the one for logistic regression, the data visualisation was made on that notebook). The model is first implemented manually from scratchand then using libraries. The goal of the manual implementation is to deepen my understanding of GDA model.

## Key Features
- Feature Selection: from multiple physical factors of the tumor
- GDA model: implementation with sklearn library and manual implementation
- Data Visualization with matplotlib and pandas

## Features selection

- Only the ID feature was removed

## Results

- Both manual and libraries based implementation gets an accuracy score above 94%. Even if this model is quite simple, the results are quite good and seems to be a good model for tumor type prediction
